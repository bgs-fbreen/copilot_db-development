| 2025 | Mar 15 | $1,179.00 | +$132 (+12.6%) |

### Market Comparison (Michigan Rental Properties)

#### Typical Landlord/Dwelling Fire Insurance Rates

| Coverage Type | Typical Annual Cost | Your Cost | Assessment |
|---------------|---------------------|-----------|------------|
| Single rental (~$70k value) | $800 - $1,500 | $1,179 (819helen) | ✅ Reasonable |
| Two rentals combined (~$100k value) | $1,400 - $2,200 | $2,450 (711+905) | ⚠️ **HIGH** |

#### Per-Property Rate Analysis

| Property | Est. Value | Insurance | Rate per $1k value | Typical Rate |
|----------|------------|-----------|-------------------|--------------|
| 711pine | ~$65,000 | ~$1,225 | $18.85/$1k | $10-15/$1k |
| 905brown | ~$40,000 | ~$1,225 | $30.63/$1k | $10-15/$1k |
| 819helen | ~$70,000 | $1,179 | $16.84/$1k | $10-15/$1k |

### Escrow Concerns

#### 🚩 1. Massive 2025 Increase on 711pine Policy
- 25% jump ($493) in one year
- Michigan average insurance increase was ~8-12% in 2024-2025
- If no claims filed, this increase needs explanation

#### 🚩 2. Double Disbursement on 819helen (2023)
- March 2023: $1,010.00
- June 2023: $1,340.11
- **Total 2023: $2,350.11** for a single property
- This needs immediate explanation from the bank

#### 🚩 3. Payee Listed as Bank, Not Insurance Company
- All disbursements show "Central Savings Bank" as payee
- Actual insurance company name not recorded
- Verify actual premiums match escrow disbursements
- Bank may be maintaining excess escrow cushion

### Escrow Action Items

#### Request from Central Savings Bank:
1. Full escrow account statement (all years, all properties)
2. Itemized breakdown of June 2023 $1,340.11 disbursement
3. Copies of actual insurance premium invoices
4. Current escrow account balance
5. Escrow analysis showing required vs. actual balance

#### Request from Insurance Company:
1. Declaration pages for all policies
2. Premium history by year
3. Coverage amounts for each property
4. Claims history (if any)

### Potential Insurance Savings

| Option | Description | Potential Savings |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|
| Shop for new insurance | Get competing quotes | $400-600/year on 711+905 policy |
| Remove escrow | Pay insurance directly | Eliminates bank cushion, you keep float |
| Combine all 3 MHB properties | Multi-property discount (10-15%) | $300-500/year |

**Estimated current annual insurance:** ~$3,630 (all MHB properties)
**Potential with optimization:** ~$2,800-3,200/year
**Potential annual savings:** $430-830/year
